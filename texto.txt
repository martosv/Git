I was born the 17 th of January of 1989 in Baeza, a little city located in the spanish region of Jaén. I have studied there in the school called Antonio Machado. When I was 12, I started to study Secondary School and Bachelor of Science in the institute called Andrés de Valdervira. 

After, I have studied the master degree at Chemical Engineer in the Universidad de Granada. I have just finished my final project which is about the desing of a petrochemical plant of propylene oxide production.
